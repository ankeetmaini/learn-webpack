A simple app to learn Webpack like a Boss!

# running

```bash
npm start
```

## Things to achieve with Webpack
- [x] Bundle all JavaScript. Meh
- [x] Use Node server to do it, no `webpack-dev-server`
- [x] Use Babel for ES6 and JSX
- [x] Use Hot reloading. Yay!
- [x] Generate `index.html` on the fly
- [x] Have `source-maps` to debug like a Boss!
- [x] Have a sample app ready? Yay `bundle.js` is **1MB**, Optimize!
- [x] Have CSS bundled in
- [ ] Hot reloading keeping the state intact, transforms!
- [ ] Show errors on browser, *react-transform-catch-erros*, Sir Dan Abramov!
- [ ] Generate Webpack conf for DEV and PROD
- [ ] Extract CSS separately
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
  - [x] Dedupe, reduces the bundle size a little > 0 :P
  - [ ] Minification [PROD only]
  - [ ] Define `NODE_ENV=PRODUCTION` for React and other perf improvements
- [x] Separate bundles for app and vendor
- [x] Hashing
- [x] Common chunking, zzzzzz
- [ ] Server rendered? Huhh?
- [ ] PostCSS, kill me now?
- [ ] Finally, clean the build folder, will you please?
