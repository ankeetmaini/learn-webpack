A simple app to learn Webpack like a Boss!

# running

```bash
npm start
```

## Things to achieve with Webpack
- [x] Bundle all JavaScript. Meh
- [x] Use Node server to do it, no `webpack-dev-server`
- [x] Use Babel for ES6 and JSX
- [x] Use Hot reloading. Yay!
- [x] Generate `index.html` on the fly
- [x] Have `source-maps` to debug like a Boss!
- [x] Have a sample app ready? Yay `bundle.js` is **1MB**, Optimize!
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Separate bundles for app and vendor
- [ ] Hashing
- [ ] Common chunking, zzzzzz
